1. Copy the ".vtf" file over to your computer and place it anywhere preferably on your Desktop
2. Start TF2
3. Click on Options > Multiplayer
4. Underneath "Spraypaint image", click on "Import Spray..."
5. Import the ".vtf" file you copied over
5a. If the preview of the spray appears to be either flashing, or black, that doesn't exactly mean it's not working, you'll need to try it in game to find out. 
6. Click "Apply" then "OK" in the bottom right
7. Your done!

Note: You can delete the ".vtf" file you copied to your Desktop, as once you import it, TF2 makes and stores a copy of it.
*Note: The speed of it is a restriction of the Source engine, unfortunately there is no way around that at this time.
